# Line Follower Robot (V1)

This is my first autonomous robotics project built using Arduino.
The robot follows a black line on a white surface using IR sensors and DC motors.

## Components Used
- Arduino UNO
- IR sensors (digital)
- DC motors + motor driver
- 4xAA battery pack
- Chassis and wheels

## Working Principle
- IR sensors detect the line
- Based on sensor output, motor directions are adjusted
- The robot follows straight paths reliably

## Current Status (V1)
- Line detection works correctly
- Robot follows straight sections
- Stops or struggles at sharp turns due to sensor and power limitations

## Challenges Faced
- Power instability and Arduino resets
- Motor current draw issues
- Mechanical instability due to caster wheel

## Future Improvements (V2)
- Replace digital IR sensors with analog sensors
- Implement obstacle avoidance
- Improve mechanical stability
- Increase speed and smoothness
